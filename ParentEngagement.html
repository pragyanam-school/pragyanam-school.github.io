      <h2 class="text-center mb-4">About Parent Engagement</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">At Pragyanam School, we strongly believe in fostering a strong partnership between parents and the school. We understand the importance of parental involvement in a child's education and strive to provide various avenues for meaningful engagement. Our parent engagement initiatives are designed to ensure open communication, transparency, and support between parents and the school community.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Transparency and Communication</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">We value the trust you place in us as educators, which is why we have implemented measures to ensure transparency in our operations. Through our Live CCTV Feed, parents have the opportunity to witness their child's school activities and classroom environment in real-time. We believe in providing full visibility to parents, making Pragyanam School an open and transparent community.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4">ParentApp</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">Stay connected and informed with our dedicated ParentApp. This user-friendly application keeps parents updated on various aspects of their child's academic journey. From attendance records and homework assignments to fee payments and important news and events, the ParentApp serves as a comprehensive platform for seamless communication between parents and the school.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Parent-Teacher Meetings</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">We value the importance of parent-teacher collaboration and recognize the need for regular updates on your child's progress. To facilitate this, we organize quarterly Parent-Teacher Meetings. These meetings provide an opportunity for parents and teachers to discuss the academic and overall development of each student. We encourage open dialogue, allowing parents to share their insights and concerns while working together to support their child's growth.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Parent Support</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">We understand that parents may have questions, concerns, or inquiries throughout their child's educational journey. At Pragyanam, we have implemented a dedicated Parent Support system to ensure prompt and professional resolution of your queries. Each email you send initiates a support ticket, and our team commits to responding within one business day. We value your input and are here to support you every step of the way.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Join the Pragyanam Parent Community</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">Pragyanam Parent Engagement fosters an inclusive and collaborative environment, where parents are valued as essential partners in their child's educational journey. We believe that by working together, we can create the best possible learning experience for our students.</p>
